Used a `GLMM` with different nesting of random effects to test for the hypothesis that state-level differences in chewing tobacco usage amongst high school students are much larger than differences between schools within a state. In other words, if one was interested in identifying locations with many tobacco chewers (in order to sell chewing tobacco to children), or if one prefer to implement programs to reduce tobacco chewing, would it be more important to find individual schools with high chewing rates or would targeting those states where chewing is most common be sufficient? 



- `smoke.RData` is the original data from `2014 American National Youth Tobacco Survey`
- `GLMM.Rmd` is the R source code.
- `GLMM.pdf` is the report.
