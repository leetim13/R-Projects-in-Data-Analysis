This is a data analysis project on the potential discrimination against American Hispanics after Trump's election in 2016, which the media has claimed. The main hypothesis is that Trump's election has led to higher stress induced for American Hispanics, leading to a decrease in the proportion of babies born who are male in this population. One of the assumptions made is that women in the early stages of pregnancy are susceptible to miscarriage or spontaneous abortion when put under stress, and for biological reasons male fetuses are more at risk than female fetuses, Retnakaran and Ye (2020). Hence, we will investigate the sex ratio at birth before and after Trump's election using both a Generalized Additive model (`GAM`) and Generalized Additive Mixed model (`GAMM`) with both cross-validation and maximum likelihood estimation, accounting for random effects for both `bygroups` and `time`.

The dataset used was retrieved from `wonder.cdc.gov`, and contains monthly birth counts in the US for Hispanics and Non-Hispanic Whites, for rural and urban areas.

`Hispanics_discrimination_after_trump_election.pdf` is the final report. \
`Hispanics_discrimination_after_trump_election.rmd` is the R source code.
