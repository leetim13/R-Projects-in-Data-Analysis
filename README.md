# R-Projects-in-Data-Analysis
A collection of data analysis and modelling projects using R.

Models implemented includes:
- Generalized Additive models `(GAMs)` (using both cross-validation and maximum likelihood estimation) in `COVID-19-Death-Count-Prediction`
- Generalized Additive Mixed models `(GAMMs)` (using both cross-validation and maximum likelihood estimation)  in `COVID-19-Death-Count-Prediction`
- Generalized Linear Models `(GLMs)`
- Generalized Linear Mixed Models `(GLMMs)`
- Linear Mixed Models `(LMMs)` in `Linear mixed models on Students’ scores`
- Multiple Linear Regression`(MLRs)` in `Linear mixed models on Students’ scores`
- Case-Control Studies
