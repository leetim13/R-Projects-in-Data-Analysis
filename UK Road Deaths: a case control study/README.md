We want to investigate whether the UK road accident data are consistent with the hypothesis that women tend to be, on average, safer as pedestrians than men, particularly as
teenagers and in early adulthood. The analysis is done in the format a case-control study, using GLM as neccessary.

- data retrieved from `www.gov.uk/government/statistical-datasets/ras30-reported-casualties-in-road-accidents`.
- `case_control.Rmd` is the R source code
- `case_control.pdf` is the final report
